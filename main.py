# Practice A

# Input 
name = (input("Please enter your first name: "))
quiz1 = int(input("Enter your first quiz score:"))
quiz2 = int(input("Enter your second quiz score: "))
quiz3 = int(input("Enter your third quiz score: "))
num = (3)

#Process
added_quizes = quiz1 + quiz2 + quiz3
quiz_averages = added_quizes / num

# Output
print(" Hello " + name + " your average is " + str(quiz_averages) + ".")




# Practice B

# Input 
name = (input("Please enter your first name: "))
distance_drove = float(input("How many miles did you drive?: "))
gallons_gas = float(input("How many gallons of gas did you use?: "))

# Process
miles_per_gallon = distance_drove / gallons_gas

# Output

print(" Hello " + name + " you used " + str (miles_per_gallon) + " per gallon of gas on your trip. ")
